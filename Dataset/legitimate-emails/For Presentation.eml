*STEWARDSHIP & COMPLIANCE*
Take precautions to protect everyone.
Protect the Environment
Follow laws and regulations.
Consider whether your actions are beneficial. If unsure, seek advice.


Example: Students are often asked to clean their rooms before going home,
and I think it's a must and shouldn't be reminded of because it shows how
we care for the environment and shared places.


*PRINCIPLED ENTREPRENEURSHIP=E2=84=A2*
This would be a win-win situation for both parties. An example of this is
that whenever there are upcoming exams, we do group study. This will
benefit us all by sharing our knowledge with each other.


*TRANSFORMATION*For me, it says that we should adapt to the emerging
technologies because this will be the future where robots will do the work
for us, and the things that cannot be automated will be valuable for people
that need to work on them.

During my elementary days, we used to have a blackboard or whiteboard
during our discussion, but when I was in sixth grade, we used to have a
projector during our class lesson.

*KNOWLEDGE*
By Sharing your knowledge proactively. Providing and soliciting challenges
consistently and respectfully. An example of this principle is that during
our thesis defence preparation, we let our professors consult our thesis
and also identified gaps and potential weaknesses of our study, because we
wanted to have a comprehensive thesis, so we accepted critiques from
different professors and identified gaps to have a well-prepared thesis
defence to satisfy the panellists in answering their questions.

*HUMILITY*
We should evaluate our strengths, weaknesses, and contributions to
determine our worth.
We should also hold ourselves and others accountable for these principles
and not allow harm, disrespect, or unkindness.


An example is accepting your mistakes and using them to grow and improve
yourself. Another is forgiving others and understanding them.

highly skilled employee listening and considering the ideas of his
colleagues regardless of their experience or level


*RESPECT*Embrace different perspectives, experiences, aptitudes, knowledge
and skills in order to leverage the power of diversity.
Be Honest and Kind, Treat People Well, Listen to Others, Respect
Differences, Use Everyone's Skills

An example is that you are willing to listen to someone who has a different
perspective from you without interrupting them, having an open mind, and
understanding their side in order to make things better.


*SELF-ACTUALIZATION*This is like evaluating yourself to see where you excel
the most. For example, in Call of Duty Mobile, a game that I'm playing and
competing in, there are roles such as anchor, slayer, objective, and
support. For me, in order to evaluate what role you are fit for, you should
try to play all these different roles, from there, you will know for
yourself what role you will perform well.
